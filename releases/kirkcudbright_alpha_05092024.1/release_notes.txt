First build of the game! After several weeks of trial and error, there is a build that contains some of the fundemental mechanics I would like to see in "Kirkcudbright" (working title. Thinking about the title "Scarborough" as well. Or maybe something else.) There are still some systems I need to test/create/make better such as room transisitons, but this is a good start.Happy to have implemented a dialogue system with sprites that look decent, though they need to be incredibly small. Make sure to run them through PixelOver and edit in Aesprite. High reosultion art doesn't work well with the game at the size I have it. Also think about about other visual stuff once more important systems are in place.
